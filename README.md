# Web Project 

## Description 

### This project is designed to use Twitter's API to create a RESTful application. The main aim of the project is to search Twitter by entering a users Tiwtter Handler which is their @ username and display a list of their recent tweets and well as if there are re-tweets or not. 
### The project does not contain a database as it creates a live tweet stream and does not store tweets to a local machine.
